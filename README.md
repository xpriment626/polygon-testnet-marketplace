# Fullstack NFT Marketplace (MATIC)

This project demonstrates a functional understanding of the following technologies:

-   MetaMask
-   IPFS
-   ethers.js
-   Hardhat
-   NextJS
-   Tailwind CSS

The networks are configured to both the MATIC Mumbai testnet, as well as mainnet, with Alchemy as the RPC provider. However, as I strongly advocate against art theft in the NFT space, I will not be deploying to mainnet. This is to provent the trade of the free stock images I use for testing purposes.

This is not an attempt at a large scale marketplace the likes of OpenSea and Rarible, so functionality is kept to just the essentials for transactions, minting, and display.
